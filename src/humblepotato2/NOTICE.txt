Modified SignApk to be able to work on a program with a Graphical User Interface.
SignApk.java used by Appium in their project (see https://github.com/appium/sign).

 * Removed the main() method and replaced with the class constructor.
   Parameters are set to the constructor referring to the input and
   output packages. And the public and private testkey(s) were both
   directly specified. But the signature writing process and how the
   certificates are generated is still the same.
